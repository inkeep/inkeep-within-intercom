# Inkeep Intercom Application Template

By deploying this template and configuring a new intercom app you will be able to embed the Inkeep chat within your Intercom messenger seamlessly.

You can customize the Inkeep-Intercom app using elements from the [Intercom Canvas Kit](https://developers.intercom.com/docs/canvas-kit).

Using Intercom's Messenger Dashboard, you will be able to conditionally show/hide the Inkeep Intercom app based on various user and visitor properites.
